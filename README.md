# ðŸ‘Š Code-Forces

Codeforces is a website that hosts competitive programming contests. 

I will be solving maximum number of questions available on the website. The main purpose behind this is to build my problem solving skills and apply that skill to solve the daily life problems through the questions. Moreover, the purpose behind writing the codes in multiple languages is to make my grip firm on different programming languages and get exposure to various IDEs and coding environments.
