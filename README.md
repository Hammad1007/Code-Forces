# ðŸ‘Š Code-Forces

Codeforces is a website that hosts competitive programming contests. 

We will be solving maximum number of questions available on the website. The main purpose behind this is to build my problem solving skill and apply that skill to solve the daily life problems. Moreover, the purpose behind writing the codes in multiple languages is to make my grip firm on different programming languages and get exposure to various IDEs and coding environments.

### :mag: Observations and Suggestions
     ðŸ‘‰ To write a code from C++ to C or vice versa, changing the library files and inputoutput is not sufficient.
     ðŸ‘‰ To access an array's elements individually, you need to take input in array one by one.
     ðŸ‘‰ To make the code more refined, make functions.
     ðŸ‘‰ For better code, visualize the situation given in the question.
     ðŸ‘‰ It's better to code slow than to code fast.
     ðŸ‘‰ Always understand the question before attempting it.
